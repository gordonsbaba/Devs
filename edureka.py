in other to show up via local reprository

to commit, first run git add reading.txt
git commit -m "first commit"
Use git diff when you make changes to your text file

Note: To match github to git use the following command line
git config --global user.name gordonsbaba-github

git remote add origin git@github.com:gordonsbaba/Reading.git

git push remote origin

echo "# reading" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin 
git push -u origin main


…or push an existing repository from the command line
git remote add origin 
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
